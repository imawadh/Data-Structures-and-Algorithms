Phase 1 :::
    In c++, every thing is by default pass by value not pass by reference, means unless and until we specify it is pass by refernce only...
    
    int arr = {1,2,3} --> Array in c++ is pass by reference. 
    
    # If you have a reference to an object in C++, you still use . (dot), not ->.
    # When we have reference, we use -> {arrow operator}.

    Pointer = a box that stores an address (can be changed).

    Reference = another name for the same box (cannot be changed to refer to another).
    
    Different Programming Paradigm :::
        1. Brute Force
        2. DP
        3. Greedy
        4. Divide and Conquer 

    In backtarcking we follow a path for the answer, when we know that this not possible or reach one solution, we revert it and search for other possibilities....


    Think of what will be the difference when it pass by value and when it is pass by referenece ... 
        1. Pass by value +  concat ---> true --> but no pop_back()
        2. Pass by value + push_back() ---> true --> but pop_back
        3. Pass by Reference + push_back() ---> true --> but pop_back
        4. Pass by referenece + concat ---> error 

        Just think why does it happen .... ???

    p1StringPermuataion.cpp --> string based
    p2StringPermuataion.cpp --> string based
    p3StringPermuataion.cpp --> string based
    p4StringPermuataion.cpp --> index based
    p5StringPermuataion.cpp --> index based
    p6StringPermuataion.cpp --> index based

    Step of prunning and step of tracking back is the most important thing in backtarcking ....

    nRowQueens.cpp
    ratMaze.cpp
    
Phase 2 :::

Apply backtarcking with atmost 7 characters else it would result in TLE ....
