Recursion is solving problems with sub problems .... [function calling itself]

Assumption :: Decide What your function does .... 
Main Logic :: Solving Assumption with the help of subproblem..
Base Condition ::  When to stop ! 

If something is written below return statement, it is useless if written in java it would even throw error .... 


Problems in Phases :::

Phase 1::
    functionCall.cpp
    Understand CallStack 
    Segmentation Fault --> It function call doesn't terminate 
    Formal Parameters ::	The variables defined in the function declaration.
    Actual Arguments  ::	The real values passed to the function when it is called.
    Formal parameters = variables listed in the function definition
    Actual arguments = values provided when calling the function.
    factorial1.cpp
    factorial2.cpp
