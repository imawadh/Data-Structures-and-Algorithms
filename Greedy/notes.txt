Phase 1 :::
    Greedy is intutive in nature...
    Alogorithmic Paradigmns ::
        1. Brute Force --> Explore each and every possiblities 
        2. Dynamic Programmming --> to avoid repetition for already calculated values of problems 
        3. Divide and Conquer --> Divide the problem into smaller sub-problem and solve the problem 
        4. Greedy Alogorithm --> Take the local optimisation 

    Proof ::
        1. Mathematical/logical Proof 
        2. Counter Examples with dry run 
    
    LeetCode 1005 --> Maximize sum of array after k negation...
    Look into this once :::: Knapsack --> 0-1 knapsack , 0-n knapsack, fractional knapsack
    Fractional KanpSack { Sanket Sir done it custom comaparator ... }
    LeetCode 1710 --> Maximum units on a truck 
    LeetCode 881 --> Boats to save people
