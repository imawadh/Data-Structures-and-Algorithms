Rule of Sum
    The way you counted the number of paths in the previous problem is called the Rule of Sum.

        Formally, if there are 'A' ways of doing a task and 'B' ways of doing another task and both are dependant on each other - you can either perform the first task or the second task then there are 'A + B' total ways.

Rule of product
    The way you counted the number of paths in the previous problem is called the Rule of Product.

    Formally, if there are A ways to perform one task and B ways to perform a second task, and these tasks can be done independently of each other, then the total number of ways to perform both tasks is A.B
