What is Data Structure ?

    It is important for Structuring the structure/arranging data..


Why Data Structure is needed ?

    1. Save space in the memory.
    2. Access the memory is faster than dumping data in the memory
    3. 90% of data available today has been created in last 2-3 years.
    4. Storage and compuations make faster....

What is Algorithms ?

    The logic to solve the problem
    Step by step

Algorithmic Analysis

    Which algorithm is use to solve the problem

        A1 ---> t1 second to solve above problem
        A2 ---> t2 second to solve above problem

        Is A1 better than A2?
            No, It depends on the algorithm used to solve the problem in term of :
                1. logic to solve the problem
                2. Operating System/ Processor
                3. Programming Language
                

        An Algorithm should be independent of 
    
            1. Progarmming Language 
            2. Operating System/ Processor
            To do this we need :
                1. Time Complexity
                2. Space Complexity


Time Complexity :
    Time taken by an algorithm is wrong.
    How no. of operation varies with input size.
    Refer to script1 file for more information ...


    O(1) : no. of operation is independent of the input size
    O(n) : no. of operation is opeartion = input size
