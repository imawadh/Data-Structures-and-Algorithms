Phase 1 :
    What is Dynamic Programming ? 
        Advanced/ Optimised Recursion 
        Recursion --  Recursion is nothing but solving the bigger problems with sub Problems... 
        DP --> Solve the isue of Overlapping Sub Problems ... 

        Leetcode 509 --> Fibonacci Number ==> Fibonacci.cpp --> Done using Bottom Up Dp 
            It can also be done using 
        Leetcode 746 --> Min Cost Climbing Stairs ==> 
        
        // > means is better than
                0(log n) > 0(sqrt(n)) > 0(n) > 0(n * log n) > 0(n^2) > 0(n^3) >>> 0(2^n)
